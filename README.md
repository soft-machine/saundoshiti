# saundoshiti
student project uses multiple RC522 RFID readers on a single raspberry pi

The codes were built upon the classes originally available here: https://github.com/mxgxw/MFRC522-python
The file MFRC522.py is only slightly changed to not include the activation of NRSTPD (MFRC522 reset pin)
By changing this pin's state directly in the code we are able to switch between several different RFID readers.
The RST pin on all inactive cards must be set LOW. Only one at a time may be set HIGH so as to read it without disturbance from the other connected readers.
Pydub is being used to read audio files as response to RFID tag recognition.
The following information is modified from the readme file provided by mxgxw.
read, write, and dump data from a chip

MFRC522-python
==============
A small class to interface with the NFC reader Module MFRC522 on the Raspberry Pi.
This is a Python port of the example code for the NFC module MF522-AN.

## Requirements
This code requires you to have SPI-Py installed from the following repository:
https://github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py

## Examples
This repository includes two separate codes to manage sound response using 2 separate ID tags and numerous RFID modules. The final code titled "3_module_audio_response.py" is best commented as this was our final goal.

## Pins

All readers are connected to the same following pins
Only the RST pin is different for each

| Name | Pin # | Pin name   |
|:------:|:-------:|:------------:|
| SDA  | 24    | GPIO8      |
| SCK  | 23    | GPIO11     |
| MOSI | 19    | GPIO10     |
| MISO | 21    | GPIO9      |
| IRQ  | None  | None       |
| GND  | Any   | Any Ground |
| 3.3V | 1     | 3V3        |

=== RST pins per reader (A,B,C) ===
| RST_A| 15    | GPIO22     |
| RST_B| 18    | GPIO24     |
| RST_C| 22    | GPIO25     |

## Usage
Import the class by importing MFRC522 in the top of your script.
